# Tesla Financial Modeling Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive financial modeling and valuation analysis** of **Tesla Inc.**, integrating **data analytics techniques, financial forecasting, scenario modeling, and discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation.** The goal is to estimate Tesla‚Äôs fair stock price and business valuation by leveraging structured **financial data, predictive analytics, and comparative benchmarking.**

The model is built with **Excel-based financial analysis, structured scenario modeling, and dynamic sensitivity analysis** to ensure robust decision-making capabilities.

## üîç Key Data Sources & External Inputs

### **1. Drivers Sheet: Organizing External Inputs**

A **Drivers Sheet** serves as a centralized hub for external input data, ensuring easy updates and flexibility in financial forecasting.

#### **Macroeconomic Inputs:**

- **Ten-Year Treasury Yield** (Risk-Free Rate) - 0.697% as of September 18, 2020.
- **Market Risk Premium** - 5% (industry standard for equity valuation).
- **Corporate Tax Rate** - 21% (U.S. corporate tax standard).
- **Inflation Rate** - 2% (long-term economic assumption).

#### **Company-Specific Inputs:**

- **Tesla‚Äôs Stock Beta** - 2.15 (from Yahoo Finance, used in CAPM-based cost of equity).
- **Tesla‚Äôs Bond Yield** - 4.32%-4.4% (proxy for cost of debt).
- **Scenario Selection** - Three dynamic scenarios:
  - **Best Case** - High growth, low costs, favorable economic conditions.
  - **Base Case** - Expected market conditions.
  - **Worst Case** - Economic downturn, higher costs, and lower demand.

The **Drivers Sheet is linked dynamically** to all financial projections, ensuring real-time updates and flexibility across the model.

## üöò Tesla Vehicle Sales & Forecasting

### **2. Tesla‚Äôs Vehicle Models & Sales Projections**

Tesla currently offers several models, with upcoming launches expected:

- **Existing Models:** Model S, Model X, Model 3
- **New Models:**
  - **Model Y** (Crossover SUV, launched in 2020)
  - **Roadster 2** (High-performance sports car, expected 2022)
  - **Cybertruck & Semi** (Expected production: 2021)

**Sales Growth Assumptions:**

- **New Models:**
  - First 3 years: 60% annual growth.
  - Years 4-5: 10% growth.
  - Years 6-7: 8% growth.
  - Long-term: 4% stable growth.
- **Model S/X:** 4% stable annual growth.
- **Model 3/Y:** Follows past Model 3 trends.

The **forecasting method** applies structured year-over-year percentage growth to **estimate Tesla‚Äôs vehicle deliveries** dynamically across the forecast period.

## üí∞ Revenue & Average Selling Price (ASP) Forecasting

### **3. Estimating Average Selling Price of Tesla Vehicles**

**Revenue projections rely on:**

1. **Projected vehicle deliveries.**
2. **Expected ASP per model.**

| Tesla Model | Price Range ($)      | Assumed ASP ($) |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Model S/X   | $85,000 - $110,000  | $102,000        |
| Model 3/Y   | $40,000 - $60,000   | $54,000         |
| Roadster 2  | $200,000 - $250,000 | $225,000        |
| Cybertruck  | $39,900 - $76,900   | $58,400         |
| Tesla Semi  | $150,000 - $200,000 | $175,000        |

### **4. Calculating Automotive Revenue**

Formula:**Revenue = Deliveries √ó ASP**Three scenarios adjust revenue:

- **Base Case:** 100% revenue forecast.
- **Worst Case:** 98% of base case.
- **Best Case:** 102% of base case.

A **CHOOSE function** dynamically updates revenue calculations based on the selected scenario.

## üìä Gross Profit & Cost Analysis

### **5. Estimating Gross Profit % by Model**

Tesla‚Äôs gross margins vary per vehicle type. Peer benchmarking provides a structured methodology:

| Tesla Model       | Peer Companies            | Average Gross Margin (%) |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Model 3/Y         | GM, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler   | 15.6%                    |
| Model S/X         | BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen | 17%                      |
| Roadster 2        | Jaguar, Porsche, Ferrari  | 44%                      |
| Cybertruck & Semi | Industry Avg              | 20%                      |

### **6. Forecasting Cost of Sales**

Formula:**Cost of Sales = Revenue - Gross Profit**

- Cost structure adjusts for **best, base, and worst-case scenarios.**
- A **dynamic chart** visualizes revenue vs. gross profit margin over time.
